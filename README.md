## Detailed Guide

### Release Notes

To **learn what's new** with the latest updates, read the release notes [here](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX/releases). Note that I follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) which means that the `major` (first) number in a version like `1.0.0` will only change if there's either a breaking change with something like the config file format (users with the old version then wouldn't be able to open the file saved with the new version), or if there's a significant change in the usage flow of the app (so users need to change their habits). A **migration guide** will be provided in the release notes for every breaking change.

### Roadmap

I am an **Indie Developer** and I want to develop and maintain multiple apps. Some of them are small-scoped one-off app ideas, but this is one of the larger scoped projects with potential for more features. For projects like this, I try to provide **exactly 1 new feature per month** (there's no limit on bug fixes). By voting on bug reports and feature requests (see below), you help me prioritize. You can always find **my current roadmap** of bugs & features I want to work on within **the next 3 months** [here](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open).

### Reporting bugs or unexpected behavior

Go to the **"Issues"** tab and search for your bug first. **Upvote** (via üëç) if you find it and provide a **comment** if your problem slightly differs from the authors. If you can't find it, press **"New issue"** and select the **"Report a bug"** template or just [click here](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX-Feedback/issues/new?labels=Bug+Report&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBug%5D+%3Cyour+bug+title%3E).
Fill out the sections to help me understand your problem as good as possible so I can provide an approprate fix.

### Requesting new features

Go to the **"Issues"** tab and search for your feature first. **Upvote** (via üëç) if you find it and provide a **comment** if your use case slightly differs from the authors. If you can't find it, press **"New issue"** and select the **"Request a feature"** template or just [click here](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX-Feedback/issues/new?labels=Feature+Request&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFeat%5D+%3Cyour+feature+title%3E).
Fill out the sections to help me understand your use case as good as possible so I can provide an appropriate feature design.

### Asking for help

Go to the **"Discussions"** tab, select the category **"Help / FAQ"** and **search** for your question there. If you can't find it, create a **new thread** or just [click here](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX/discussions/new?category=help-faq). If you do find it, make sure to upvote (via ‚¨ÜÔ∏è) and **comment** with your use case in case yours slightly differs from the authors.
