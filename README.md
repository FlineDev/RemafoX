## Detailed Guide

### Reporting bugs or unexpected behavior

Go to the **"Issues"** tab and search for your bug first. **Upvote** (via üëç) if you find it and provide a **comment** if your problem slightly differs from the authors. If you can't find it, press **"New issue"** and select the **"Report a bug"** template or just [click here](https://github.com/FlineDev/ReMafoX-Feedback/issues/new?labels=Bug+Report&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBug%5D+%3Cyour+bug+title%3E).
Fill out the sections to help me understand your problem as good as possible so I can provide an approprate fix.
